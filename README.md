# covid-trends
- This repository houses a Jupyter Notebook which contains Julia code for generating various plots for visualization of Covid-19 data
- The data is collected from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 which is a repository owned by Johns Hopkins University
- The last plot is inspired from https://aatishb.com/covidtrends
- A better look at the notebook can be achieved by downloading it as Github has faulty rendering for Jupyter Notebooks. Besides the most creative and amazing plots toward the end require Interact which won't be rendered outside Jupyter Notebook environment.
- The Julia version used here is 1.6.1.
